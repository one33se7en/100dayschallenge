## Day Log

Today just wasn’t the day. I felt resistance, felt low, felt like doing nothing — but now I feel I shouldn’t chase perfectionism. I should be proud that I’m taking actions that many are not.

> "Small actions beat inaction every time."

The day started at a solid 6:00 AM. Sunrise had already happened, so I prayed *qadha*.  
Yesterday, due to some family issues, I wasn’t able to sleep until 12AM and didn’t write my journal on GitHub — wrote it in the morning and pushed it.

I was feeling really low and didn’t feel like going to the gym. Just laid in bed… but I went anyway :)

### Gym (8:00 AM – Chest & Back, back-focused)
- Dumbbell rows – 3 sets  
- Lat pulldown – 3 sets  
- Bent-over rows – 2 sets  
- Smith machine deadlifts – 2 sets  
- Incline DB press – 2 sets  
- Chest press – 2 sets till failure  

Didn’t feel like doing cardio — but I did it anyway :)

### Work & Hacking

Started working around 12PM. In just 2 hours, I found a valid bug, wrote the report, and submitted it by 2:30PM. Took a short break.

Tested a bit more for another 30 mins. Then laid on my bed and accidentally fell asleep.

Woke up at 6PM and prayed.

At 7PM, I started testing the 8x8 program. I found a bug, reported it, and it turned out to be a duplicate of an N/A report. Their team replied in 2 minutes — kudos to them.

I didn’t complete my step goal today — barely hit 4K — and also ate less than planned.

Today just wasn’t my day :)

But… while writing this, I just received **2 pending bounties** — low severity, but:
