# Day 1

I had alarms set for 5:15, 5:20, 5:25, and 5:30 AM â€” no idea if they actually rang, lol.  
But I ended up waking up around 6 AM and got up all of a sudden. The resistance was real â€” I could feel it from head to toe â€” but I pushed through. Freshened up, did wudu, and prayed Fajr salah.

Then I made my pre- and intra-workout drinks and headed to the gym around 7 AM.  
Stepped into the gym after almost **5 months**. Iâ€™ve lost a lot of muscle, and I feel bloated and fat at 73 kg. I started with incline dumbbell press and went as heavy as I could â€” lost a bit of strength.  
Did `10:8:8` reps with 25s on that, then moved to chest press and cable fly.  
For back, I did lat pulldowns and dumbbell rows.  
Finished with some cardio.  
Low volume, high-intensity workout. Felt good.

Got back home around 8:30 AM, took a shower, had Meal 1, and did some household chores. ðŸ˜Š

## Hacking Grind

Started hacking at 10 AM.  
In the first hour, I found what I thought was a bug on one of my favorite private programs and reported it â€” but turns out, it wasnâ€™t a bug. ðŸ˜”  
Team replied within 30 minutes , I love this program :)

Kept testing till 2 PM, verifying several test cases â€” all turned out **not vulnerable**.  
It hurts. Been hacking on this program for the past **7 months**, with ~1300 reps.  
I know there are still bugs â€” just need to dig deeper and think from different angles.

## Midday

Took a break from 2:00 to 2:30 PM and had Meal 2.  
Saw activity on a bug that a friend and I reported on **Epic Games**.

Triager couldnâ€™t reproduce it for 3 days, so he gave us his ID for reproduction.  
My friend was on a trip, so I exploited it using the triager's ID and we got it to **PPR** â€” though they lowered the severity.

We dropped a comment explaining the real impact and why it's a **high-severity issue**.  
Letâ€™s see if they bump the severity again.

## Later in the Day

Resumed testing on the private program till 4 PM but started feeling feverish with a mild headache â€” took a break and went to the market to run some errands.

Returned around 6 PM, prayed salah, then jumped into **PentesterLabâ€™s API badge labs** (shoutout to Jatin for the voucher ðŸ™Œ). These labs are really interesting and close to real-world scenarios.

Did 10 labs. At around 7:30 PM, I went to prepare dinner.

## Evening Wins

âœ… The **Epic Games bug** got triaged!  
The team replied saying theyâ€™ll **reconsider the severity while paying the bounty** â€” GG.

At 8:48 PM, had a nice **high-protein dinner** and reflected on the day.

Although I didnâ€™t find any valid bugs today, I **put in the work** â€” and that matters.  
Iâ€™ll keep testing this target until I exhaust all of my test cases, and then Iâ€™ll add a **public program** to alternate between them.

## Reflection

Productivity feels good. I'm genuinely happy when Iâ€™m productive.

But I need to get better at focus â€” I got distracted several times today due to notifications.  
**From tomorrow, Iâ€™ll work with notifications off.**

Also rewarded myself with a 50 kcal chocolate. Totally fine. ðŸ˜„

Now Iâ€™ll pray salah, watch an episode of *The Last of Us*, and sleep.
