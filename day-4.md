# Day 4


## Morning

Woke Up at 6:30 , yeah missed salat again today . But either I sit back and chase perfectionism or get up and do the rest of the task . So I got up and went to the gym. Today was arms.

Killed my lateral dealt 4 sets till faliure.  
2 biceps and 2 triceps exercise.  
Finished with cardio on treadmill.

Went home around 9AM.

## Work

Started working on another new program around 11:30 till 1 PM and reported a github api leak.  
Then I went to pray friday prayer then around 3 I started working again. till 6 I worked.

## Reflection

Honestly I want to hack all day everyday but the situation I'm in right now I just can't.  
I feel like I'm Just not doing enough, I can do better.  
I have to wake up early and learn to manage my time beacuse I need more time to hack and learn.
I will try to wake up between 5-5:30

Also I did only 7k steps today.

Today my cousin was coming so I went to pick him up :)

## Calories and Macros

I had 2 meals outside home but they are simple healthy high protein meals.  
I hit my protein goal today but I feel like I had like calories above my maintenance, so I will eat less tommorow.
