# Day 5

## Morning

I messed up today.  
I woke up at 5:50 AM, but my mind told me to sleep again — and bam, I woke up at 7:10 AM directly.  
I'll reset the challenge starting tomorrow.

Got up fresh, and went straight to the gym.  
Reached the gym at 7:30 AM.  
It was a **chest and back** day.  
I felt really low on energy, plus there was a power cut, so the ACs were off.

- First set: 10 reps with 25s.  
- Second set: failed at 5 reps.  
I was like, wtf, last time I got 8.  
Maybe it's because of sleep — last night I slept late since I slept in the evening and woke up twice during the night.

So I switched to 20s and did 12 reps till failure.

Then chest press and cable fly, 3 sets till failure.

For back:
- One vertical pull
- One horizontal pull  
(Since this was a chest-focused session, it was enough.)

Finished with rear delt fly.  
No cardio today.

## Cutting Plan (Starting Tomorrow)

I planned to eat **1500 calories**.  
I know it’s too low, but I'll take care of the protein intake — that's what matters tbh.

**Workout Plan:**
- Same workout split
- Cardio:
  - First 30 days: 10 min max incline at 4.5 speed + 10K steps daily
  - Next 30 days: 15 min max incline at 4.5 speed + 15K steps daily
  - Last 30 days: 20 min max incline at 4.5 speed + 15K steps daily

Trying to do it for 90 days.  
Let's see :)

## Afternoon

Reached home around 9:15 AM.  
Showered, had Meal 1, then got into some work till 1 PM.

At 1 PM, I started hacking.  
Chose another program today — target is self-managed; stats showed good response time.

One hour into testing, I got really hooked as the target matched my skillset.  
After 4 hours of testing, I found 2 pretty nasty privilege escalation bugs.
Reported them and packed up by 6 PM.  
I'm really excited and nervous — these are impactful bugs.  
Hoping they're not dupes.

Since I'm starting the cut from tomorrow, I had a small cheat today:
- 2 slices of pizza
- Ice cream

Now, **no cheat meals for the next 100 days**.  
It’s hard tbh, but I'll try my best.

## Checklist :

Tommorow is Day 1 again :)
