# Daily Journal - [Date]

## Morning

I woke up around 5:52 AM today.  
Prayed salah.  
Today was Sunday, so the gym opens after 8 AM.

At 6:15 AM, I started testing the target I shortlisted yesterday.  
But it turned out to be a really complex app:
- No IDs anywhere.
- The app was literally based on SQL â€” if you have to change the privilege of a user, you had to execute queries on the console.

I know I should not fear complexity, as others might have thought the same,but I tested it for 1.5 hours and nothing clicked.  
I didnâ€™t get the vibe, so I stopped and just laid on my bed, feeling demotivated.

## Gym

Around 8:15 AM, I went to the gym.  
Hit abs and cardio.  
My whole body is sore, especially my legs.  
Soreness is good, right?

## After Gym

Reached home around 9:15 AM.  
I was feeling very low.  
While scrolling X (Twitter), I saw Mohsin bhaiâ€™s 100 days challenge post.  
He mentioned that one of his Discord members taught him a technique related to the user management feature.

I texted him to ask if he wanted to disclose it â€” he said no, haha.  
Then he called me, and we talked for an hour.

Man, what a mindset and dedication he has â€” he's such an inspiration.  
I felt so much motivation after talking to him.  
He also shared two crazy API hacking tips.

Then I had Meal 1.  
After that, I went to the market with my father.

## Afternoon

Came home around 1 PM.  
Had Meal 2.  
I was so tired and low on energy today that I slept.

Woke up around 3:30 PM. Then I started testing another program.

- Found 2 bugs: one IDOR and one BAC.
- The program looks dead, btw.  
But letâ€™s see â€” if I get a reply next week, I'll hack more on that program. Wrapped up at 6 PM and prayed salah.

## Evening

After 7 PM, I pretty much did nothing because I just didnâ€™t feel like doing anything.

## Calories and Macros

I ate the same thing as yesterday.Calories were around **2000 cals**.
