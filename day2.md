# Day 2

## Morning Routine
Woke up at **6:15 AM**, made wuzu, prayed salah, and started preparing for the gym.  
Today, I skipped the pre-workout. Yesterday I felt really weird and anxious, and Iâ€™m certain it was due to the caffeine. Instead, I went for a classic: black coffee.

Reached the gym around **7:00 AM**.  
Today was **arms day**.

- Started with **lateral raises**, spamming 4 sets until failure â€“ shoulders were burning.
- Then did **2 bicep exercises** and **2 tricep exercises**.
- I forgot to train rear delts yesterday, so I made up for it today.

> I have a weird workout split â€” I hit different parts of my shoulders on different days instead of dedicating a full day. Tomorrow is **legs + front delts**.

Finished with **15 minutes of incline cardio**: incline maxed out, speed 4.5.  

## Post-Gym
Reached home by **8:30 AM**, took a shower, had **Meal 1**, and did some quick chores.

## Hacking
Started hacking at **10:30 AM** with a goal in mind:  
**Find 1 valid bug today** on private program.

Within **1.5 hours**, I found one! It was a business logic error in a very edge-case scenario that requires deep understanding of the target. Iâ€™m confident theyâ€™re going to accept it.

Then I got a notification on Discord from **Mohsin bhai (Tabahi)**'s server â€” he was open to collabs.  
I messaged him about testing this private program together. We talked for about an hour, but our thought processes didnâ€™t really match, so I called it off initially.

Went to pray **Friday namaz** around **1:00 PM**, followed by **Meal 2**.

After some reflection, I DMed him again and agreed to his terms. I realized:
> Iâ€™ve already tested this app heavily and donâ€™t have many new vectors left.  
> This collab is a great learning opportunity. 

Weâ€™ll start the collab tomorrow.  
It was genuinely a great conversation â€” he has an exceptional mindset. I learned a lot just from our chat today.

## Reporting
Wrote and submitted the report for the bug I found earlier.

## Epic Games Testing
Around **5:00 PM**, **b19r8a14** (wonâ€™t reveal his name unless he's okay with it) joined me on Discord.  
We started testing **Epic Games** together for the ongoing event.  
We didnâ€™t find anything new, but his past experience with this asset gave me great insights.  
Heâ€™s **super humble**, **skilled**, and an all-around good guy.

I wrapped up by **6:30 PM**, and then I headed to the market for some errands.

## Evening Reflection â€“ 9:00 PM

I couldâ€™ve performed way better in the Epic Games event.  
The accepted bug was mostly **b19r8a14**'s discovery â€” I just helped him a bit.

## Things to Improve

- **Networking:**  
  I'm finally making friends and connecting with skilled hackers. But Iâ€™ve been wasting too much time chatting.  
  âž¤ From **tomorrow**, Iâ€™ll dedicate **3 solid hours of solo hunting** â€” just **me, Burp, and the browser** â€” with **zero distractions**.

- **Time Efficiency:**  
  I need to reduce time spent on non-goal-related tasks.  
  âž¤ Example: Showers shouldnâ€™t take more than **10 minutes**.

> Time is limited. I have to make **every minute count**.

## Bug Bounty Log

Iâ€™ll be documenting all bounty progress here:

## Calories :
After dinner, I had aamras. Right now, my focus is on regaining lost muscle mass, which isnâ€™t too difficult. Iâ€™ll just make sure to hit my protein intake and eat clean for a month. After that, Iâ€™ll get stricter with both my diet and cardio.
