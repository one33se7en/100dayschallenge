# Day-2



## Morning

Woke up at 5:45 AM and prayed.  
Yesterday I slept without even realizing it, so I forgot to write an update.  
Wrote a quick summary this morning.

Reached the gym around 7:30 AM.  
Today was **Leg Day**, and I donâ€™t know why, but lately Iâ€™ve been really excited about leg sessions.

Started the workout at 7:45 AM:

- **Squats**: 10â€“8â€“6 at 60 kg  
  - Goal: Reach 20â€“20â€“20 before increasing weight
- **Leg Extension & Leg Curl**: 2 sets each till failure  
- **Calf Raises**: Finisher

**Cardio**:  
- 10 minutes treadmill  
- Max incline, 4.5 speed

Finished at 9:15 AM and headed home.

## Cutting Strategy

Decided to ease into a deficit to avoid:
- Muscle loss  
- Metabolic adaptation  
- Strength decline

My maintenance: **2400 calories**  
Even 2000 cals is already a solid deficit and ideal for recomp.

### The Plan:

**Month 1**  
- 2000 calories  
- High-intensity training  
- 10 min treadmill (max incline, 4.5 speed)  
- 10K steps/day

**Month 2**  
- 1800 calories  
- Same workout  
- 15 min treadmill (same incline/speed)  
- 10K steps/day

**Month 3**  
- 1500 calories  
- Same workout  
- 20 min treadmill (same incline/speed)  
- 10K steps/day

The plan looks solid â€” I just hope I execute it well.

## Hacking

Started working around 1 PM.  
Didnâ€™t find any new bugs today, but I'm building a better understanding of the new target.  
Worked till 6 PM with a 1-hour break.

### Current Status:
- **3 pending bounties**
- **5 reports in 'New' state**  
I hope all of them get validated this week.

## Things to Improve

- Wasting too much time on distractions â€” chatting, scrolling, etc.  
  â†’ Need to cut the noise and double down on bug bounty focus.
- Not learning anything new.  
  â†’ From tomorrow, Iâ€™ll dedicate **1 hour daily** to learning.
- Not sleeping on time.  
  â†’ Iâ€™ll start sleeping between **10â€“11 PM** from tomorrow.
