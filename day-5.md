## Day-5

It's 11:30PM I'm so tired and sleepy, and my mother is sick.

So here is the quick summary for the day, I woke up around 5:30 prayed salah and reached gym around 6:30.

### Workout
- Today was legs and front dealt
- 3 sets of squats on 60 kgs â€” 10:10:8  
- 3 sets of leg extension  
- 3 sets of hamstring curl  
- 2 sets of front dealt  
- 10 min cardio on treadmill  

Reached home around 8AM  
Shower and meal 1 till 9:30AM  

### Hacking Progress
Started hacking around 10AM. I was reading docs of the target and started exploring GraphQL API of the target which I was avoiding for a long time.  
Luckily I found a BAC.  
Till 1PM I was finding ways to increase the impact. Then I took 1 hour break.  
Started again from 2PM and in 1 hour I found a way to increase the impact.  
Wrote a nice report and submitted it.

**Suprisingly**, I got this mail from the CEO of the company.

**I mean WOW, this made my day.**

After 4PM there were thunderstorms and I stopped hacking.

Around 7PM Mohsin bhai (tabahi) called and we talked for more than an hour. It was really nice talking to him, we talked about life, gym, mindset, and techniques.
