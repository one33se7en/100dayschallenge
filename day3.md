# Day 3

## Morning

Yesterday, I slept around 1 AM.  
Something happened, and my mind got really disturbed.  
When you take too much stress, it reflects on your behavior with people.  
It's better to go silent when you have a lot going on in your mind.  
I'm short-tempered, especially with the people I love â€” people who love and care about me â€” and I have to work on this one.

I woke up at 6:17 AM and realized that the sun is rising around 6:30 AM, and my salah is becoming qadha,  
as I take a minimum of 10 minutes to freshen up.  
I have to wake up between 5â€“6 AM from tomorrow.

I prayed fajr qadha and then went to the gym.

## Gym

Reached the gym around 7:15 AM.  
Today was chest day (leg day, just kidding). I hit legs today.

Started with:
- Squats â€” 3 sets at 60 kg till failure.
  - I won't go heavy on squats.
  - I will focus on hypertrophy only and try to hit 20:20:20 reps.
  - Only then will I increase the weight.
- Followed by leg extension
- Then hamstring curl
- Finished the leg workout with calf raises.
- Then I did shoulder press â€” 3 sets.

Finished the workout and went home.  
No cardio today.

## After Gym

Reached home around 9 AM.  
Had Meal 1, took a shower, and did some household work.

## Hacking Session

Sat on my laptop at 11 AM.  
I am finally thinking of moving on from the program I was hacking on for the last 7 months.

From 11 AM to 5 PM (with an hour break from 2â€“3 PM):
- I manually looked into 130 private invites.
- Signed up in every app.
- Looked into features to see if they match my skillset or not.
- Did some light testing on some apps.
- Bookmarked 36 programs, out of which I selected 4.

One program has a veryyyyy wide scope, so I DMed a recon guy for collaboration, and he said yes.  
So 3 programs I will do solo along with my main program.  
I will spend one week on each program, report some bugs, see the team's response, and then decide if I want to continue.  
From tomorrow, I will test one program where a campaign is ongoing â€” still 9 days left.  
I hope I will find something.

This multiple program strategy I learned from Yash Sharma â€”  
He just switches between 10â€“15 programs and is quick to find bugs.  
I've learned a lot from him, and I should at least start with 4.

## Evening

From 5â€“6 PM:
- I tested a 2FA feature in one of the apps.
- I tried everything; it turned out not to be vulnerable.

Stopped at 6 PM and went to the market for some work.

Had dinner at 9 PM.

## Things to Improve

- Cutting out distractions and going deep into the new program from tomorrow
- Waking up between 5â€“6 AM

## Reflections

Honestly, I am still overthinking stuff, but I can't do anything about it right now.  
It's better to sleep and do it again tomorrow.

Good Night.

## Calories
I had a high protein wheat bun burger in the evening and I didn't tracked it's calories so today I ate approx 2000 kcals.
